A simple web browser for Unix system packages 

WORK IN PROGRESS!!

Usage instructions:

  git clone git://github.com/ohadlevy/dish.git
  cd dish
  git submodule init
  git submodule update

  copy config/database.yml.example to config/database.yml (and modify if you don't want to use sqlite)
  rake db:migrate

In order to send the package information to dish you have at least two options - post over http, or run it locally from the dish server:

1. post over http
   use extras/push_info.rb script
2. run from the dish server
   use script/import script (usage ./script/runner script/import)

In both cases, you would need to modify the scripts in order to get the host list - get it somehow (I use it from foreman)

Start your webserver (./script/server) - You may start it while the import is running.

Most likely this will be end up as part of theforeman.org project.
