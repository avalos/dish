A simple web browser for Unix system packages 

WORK IN PROGRESS!!

Usage instructions:

  git clone github.com/ohadlevy/dish.git
  cd dish
  git submodule init
  git submodule update
  rake db:migrate

modify script/import to have a host list - get it somehow (I use it from foreman)

run ./script runner ./script/import (you would need ssh access to the remote machines & facter installed)

start your webserver (./script/server)
you would not need to wait until it finishes.

most likely this will be end up as part of theforeman.org project.
