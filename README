A simple web browser for Unix system packages 

WORK IN PROGRESS!!

Usage instructions:

  git clone git://github.com/ohadlevy/dish.git
  cd dish
  git submodule init
  git submodule update

  copy config/database.yml.example to config/database.yml (and modify if you don't want to use sqlite)
  rake db:migrate

In order to send the package information to dish you would need to run an import script (can be done from any machine in your network)

	use extras/push_info.rb script

You would need to modify the script in order to get the host list - get it somehow (I use it from foreman)

start the background service (as we process the package information in the background not to keep the web browser busy)
rake jobs:work (leave it running)

Start your webserver (./script/server) - You may start it while the import is running.

Most likely this will be end up as part of theforeman.org project.
